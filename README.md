# Ask-TextFiles
A langchain app that allows you to ask questions to a .txt file

This is a Python application that enables you to load a .txt file and ask questions about its contents using natural language. The application leverages Language Models (LLMs) to generate responses based on the .txt data. The LLM will only provide answers related to the information present in the .txt file.
